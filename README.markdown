Opera is a great browser, but one feature it’s been lacking for a very long
time is the ability to view the passwords you’ve saved with the Opera password
manager (“The wand”).

There are a few closed-source and Windows-only programs out there. An
open-source multi-platform utility to read the wand seemed like a good idea :-) 

operapass can be run from in a terminal or with a basic GUI. It should find the
wand.dat in your Opera profile directory, but you can also specify it as the
first parameter (eg.. `operapass-tk path/to/wand.dat`)

There are two utilities: `operapass-dump` to dump the password file to your
stdout (ie. terminal) and `operapass-tk` for a very basic TKinter GUI. 

It should run on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and OSX.

Notes
=====
operapass can currently **only read wand files without a master password**. Note
you can remove and (re-)add a master password at any time in the Opera
preferences. 

operapass will use the [M2Crypto][1] module when available, and fall back to pyDes
(bundled) when it’s not, note that M2Crypto is *much* faster. M2Crypto isn’t
available for Python 3 yet.
